# Recommendation System
Java Assignment for Data Structures & Algorithms 

We had to start doing a Movie Recommendation system like they use on sites like Netflix etc.
The aim of this assignment was to be able to read data from an external file, use good quality code and also to get familiar with JUnit testing.
